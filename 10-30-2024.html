                        <p>In a season so improbable for the Dodgers, where they were portrayed as the underdogs, even though they had the best record in the MLB.</p>
                        <p>The Dodgers had three starting pitchers, a breakout veteran pitcher Jack Flaherty, rookie Yoshinobu Yamamoto, and a Walker Buehler recovering from Tommy John surgery.</p>
                        <p>As they essentially had no starting rotation, they were looked at as a team that would exit the playoffs early, like the two years prior. However, an underlooked asset of the Dodgers was their lockdown bullpen.</p>
                        <p>Everybody knew that the Cleveland Guardians had an amazing bullpen, but the Dodgers had a great bullpen as well. The dodgers had a number of leverage arms, including Alex Vesia, Blake Treinen, Brusdar Graterol, Michael Kopech, Ryan Brasier, and Anthony Banda. Additionally, they had inning eaters Brent Honeywell, Landon Knack, and Ben Casparius for blowouts or long games.</p>
                        <p>The Dodgers' pitching strategies were unheard of in the postseason, but their combination of bullpen games and short starts seemed ineffective, but as their trophy shows, the strategy worked.</p>
                        <p>The game began pretty badly for the Dodgers, whose ace Jack Flaherty gave up 5 runs over a very short start. However, the Yankees' errors fumbled their 5 run lead, the largest choke in postseason history in a clinching game.</p>
                        <p>After Flaherty, the Dodgers bullpen once again locked down the Yankees hitters, especially with Blake Treinen, who had a 2.1 inning outing.</p>
                        <p>Treinen had a 259 DL+ that game, as his amazing peripherals boosted him over to the high stat. He was 159% better than the average pitcher, and he was an integral part of the Dodgers' world championship in 2024.</p>
                        <p>For now, Ace of the Day will be momentarily paused, starting again in next year's season. However, throughout the offseason, we will be writing about the Analytics Ace Awards for best pitchers, trades, and free agent signings.</p>
