                        <p>In the much-anticipated world series between the Dodgers and the Yankees, Game 1 could not have been more fitting. The teams were deadlocked for the first couple frames until a Will Smith sacrifice fly gave the Dodgers a 1 run advantage.</p>
                        <p>However, Giancarlo Stanton managed to hit a moonshot in the 6th inning to give the Yankees a 2-1 lead. The Dodgers tied it up at 2-2 again, forcing extra innings. In the top of the 10th, it seemed that the Yankees won, as Jazz Chisolm used his speed to swipe second and third, and came home on an Anthony Volpe fielder's choice to give the Yankees a 3-2 lead.</p>
                        <p>After getting Will Smith out, the Yankees intentionally walked Mookie Betts to load the bases for Freddie Freeman, who was playing through a severe ankle sprain. Freeman deposited the first pitch that he saw from Nestor Cortes Jr. into the right field pavilion, hitting the first walk-off grand slam in World Series history and sending the Dodger players and fans into a frenzy.</p>
                        <p>Freeman's walk-off was reminiscent of Kirk Gibson's legendary walk-off home run in game 1 of the 1988 World Series. Both balls were hit at 8:37, both had severely injured legs, both were walk-offs, and both will be forever remembered. Joe Davis paid homage to the great Vin Scully with the call, "She is gone!" and exclaimed, "Gibby meet Freddie!".</p>
                        <p>Although the loss left a sour taste in their mouth, the Yankees received a stellar performance from Gerrit Cole, who had a DL+ of 146 thanks to his hard hit prevention and excellent peripherals. He outdueled opponent Jack Flaherty who let up too much hard contact and a home run.</p>
