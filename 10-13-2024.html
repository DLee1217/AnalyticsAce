                    <div class="post-content">
                        <p>In a season of unprecedented injuries, Jack Flaherty has been a pivotal pitcher for the Dodgers, providing an anchor for a pitching staff stripped of arm. Acquired from the Tigers minutes before the trade deadline, Jack Flaherty immediately made his presence known with a collection of successful starts heading into the postseason.</p>
                        <p>Coming into the 2024 season, the theoretical Dodgers rotation was Tyler Glasnow, Yoshinobu Yamamoto, Bobby Miller, Walker Buehlder, and Gavin Stone. However, all five of these starters have missed significant amounts of time, and the current pitching situation for the Dodgers is a three man rotation of Yoshinobu Yamamoto, Jack Flaherty, and a shaky Walker Buehler.</p>
                        <p>Amidst this pitching chaos however, the Dodgers managed to tie the MLB record for the most consecutive scoreless innings pitched in the postseason, at 33. Jack Flaherty's strong start and 1 inning each from Daniel Hudson and rookie Ben Casparius sealed the deal with a 9 - 0 blowout win and the 33rd consecutive scoreless inning. The Dodgers also became the third team in MLB postseason history to pitch three consecutive shutouts.</p>
                        <p>The Dodgers jumped out to an early 1 - 0 lead ahead of the Mets in the NLCS, and historically, teams that have won Game 1 of a best of 7 series win the series 64% of the time. As the Dodgers strive towards the first World Series appearance in 4 years, when they won it all in 2020, they will have to manage pitching efficiently, as already, Alex Vesia, the top reliever in the Dodgers bullpen, has been sidelined from the NLCS with an intercostal injury.</p>
                        <p>Jack Flaherty had an impressive 117 DL, not as dominant as Matthew Boyd, as he allowed more hard hit balls, his average exit velocity was higher, and had a lower K%. However, Flaherty did throw a gem of a game, going seven shutout innings, putting the Dodgers in a position to win the NLCS.</p>
