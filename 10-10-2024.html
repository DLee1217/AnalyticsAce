                    <div class="post-content">
                        <p>The New York Yankees steamrolled past the Kansas City Royals on their road to the ALCS, riding on the back of great pitching and timely hitting. Gerrit Cole provided 7 strong innings on Thursday, giving up only 1 run on 6 hits. Although he looked good from the outside, Cole had given up many hard hit balls and hard contact, while not being able to induce soft contact. However, that was not enough to bring his DL down, as his score was 114, higher than the Royals' Michael Wacha.</p>
                        <P>Giancarlo Stanton and Gleyber Torres had multi-hit games, leading the way for the Yankees offense, along an RBI hit from superstar Juan Soto. The Yankees, who have not seen ALCS baseball since 2022, when the Astros walked them off.</P>
                        <p>Looking for their first World Series title since 2009, the Yankees have been in a postseason slump lately, and with the addition of Juan Soto and Jazz Chisolm to their already stacked lineup with Aaron Judge, Giancarlo Stanton, and Gleyber Torres, it will be bust if they do not win it all this year.</p>
                        <p>As usual, Gerrit Cole looked like the ace he is, and we will keep watching with interest to see how he will perform as the postseason progresses.</p>
                        <p>Thank you for reading, and see you again on tomorrow's edition of Ace of the Day!</p>
