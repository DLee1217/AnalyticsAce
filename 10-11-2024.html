                    <div class="post-content">
                        <p> After the Los Angeles Dodgers jumped out in the NLDS aginst the San Diego Padres 1-0, the Padres rallied back, winning back-to-back games, putting the Dodgers in yet another elimination game. The Dodgers hadn't made it past the Divisional Series since 2021, when they were eliminated by the Braves in the NLCS. In game 4 of this year's NLDS, the Dodgers rallied behind a flawless bullpen shutout and huge runs from the offense, to take the game with a demanding score of 8-0. This win set the stage for a winner-take-all game 5 at home for the Dodgers at Dodger Stadium. </p>
                        <p>Yoshinobu Yamamoto, the Dodgers' new $375 million pitcher, was set to be on the bump for this crucial game. Although he had started the season strong, a shoulder issue kept him out for three months, and he had only made a handful of starts back before the postseason, where he looked shaky at best. However, Yamamoto came out on Friday with his stuff, dominating with his fastball and putting batters away with his offspeed. </p>
                        <p>Such a dominant start was one that the Dodgers desperately needed, as their starting rotation was stripped bare, with injuries to Tyler Glasnow, Shohei Ohtani (as a pitcher), Clayton Kershaw, Tony Gonsolin, Dustin May, Gavin Stone, Bobby Miller, Emmett Sheehan, River Ryan, Michael Grove, Walker Buehler, and Kyle Hurt, not to mention Yamamoto himself. The Dodgers jumped out to an early lead thanks to a Kike Hernandez solo home run, and they never looked back, increasing their lead in the 7th with a Teoscar Hernandez home run.</p>
                        <p>Of the two starters today, Yoshinobu Yamamoto and Yu Darvish, Yamamoto had a signficantly higher dL, albeit still below average at 96. The Dodgers look to continue their success into the NLCS, where they face off against the New York Mets, whose season can only be described as miraculous.</p>
