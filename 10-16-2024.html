                        <p>Walker Buehler, once the leader of a promising Dodgers rotation, had undergone his second Tommy John surgery and had missed the entire 2023 season rehabbing. When he returned, Buehler struggled mightily, posting a 5.39 ERA and losing more games than he won.</p>
                        <p>However, the goal of baseball is to win in October, and Buehler was able to do that on Wednesday with a strong 4 inning start against the Mets, surrendering 0 runs on 3 hits. He faced off against Luis Severino, the Mets power pitcher, who gave up two unearned run on his way to an NLCS loss.</p>
                        <p>Buehler's first start in the postseason, game 3 of the NLDS, raised doubts that he would be able to perform on the highest stage, as he gave up 6 runs in a 6 - 5 loss against the Padres. However, he rebounded in his next start, providing just enough length for the Dodgers bullpen to take over and shut the Mets down.</p>
                        <p>It appears that Buehler is done for the rest of the NLCS, and if the Dodgers advance to the World Series, he is sure to pitch in either game 2 or game 3.</p>
                        <p>Recently, the DL stat was changed to DL+, with 100 being league average and the pitcher would be DL - 100 % better than the average pitcher. In his latest start, Buehler achieved a 116 DL+, meaning he was 16% better than the average pitcher. He edged out Luis Severino, who recorded a 107 DL+. Buehler was unable to induce soft contact, but had a good strikeout percentage, which brought him over Severino.</p>
