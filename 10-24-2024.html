                        <p>The upcoming world series, a matchup of the ages, is going to be a slugfest, with likely MVPs Aaron Judge and Shohei Ohtani, among other power bats. In this series, pitching and run prevention will play a massive role, so let's break down the rotations of the Dodgers and Yankees to see how they stack up.</p>
                        <p>First, let's compare the 1 starters. On the Yankees side, we have Gerrit Cole, who had a 151 DL+. He was dominant this year, and comes slightly ahead of Jack Flaherty, who had a 147 DL+. Both pitchers have been successful this year, with Cole finding dominance yet again, and Flaherty having a bouncback year. Advantage: Yankees.</p>
                        <p>Next, let's compare the 2 starters. We have Rodon on the Yankees side, with a 140 DL+. He had a solid year, but Yoshinobu Yamamoto's rookie year edged him out, with a 163 DL+. For the 2 starter, the Dodgers look stronger. Advantage: Dodgers.</p>
                        <p>For the next comparison, we take the 3 starters. The Yankees have Clarke Schmidt, who had a DL+ of 148 during the season, beats a struggling Buehler with a 97 DL+. For the third string starter, the Yankees clearly have the upper hand. Advantage: Yankees.</p>
                        <p>Finally, let's take a look at each bullpen's most successful POSTSEASON RELIEVER. The stats that are used will be the postseason stats, to get a better measure of their clutch abilities. Luke Weaver, the Yankees' best reliever, has a 136 DL+, showing dominance but not having good home run and hard hit prevention. Blake Trienen, the Dodgers' best reliever, had a DL+ of 216, showing he was the superior pitcher. Advantage: Dodgers.</p>
